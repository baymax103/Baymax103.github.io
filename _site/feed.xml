The first Muppet was made by Jim Henson. Muppets first appeared on an educational show called Sam and Friends, and then they appeared on Sesame Street. Later, people made “The Muppet Show” for fun instead of education. The Muppet show has many unique Muppets, such as Kermit the Frog, Grover, and Oscar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first character made by Jim Henson was Kermit the Frog. It is the most famous Muppet on the show. The original Kermit puppet was made out of Jim Henson’s mom’s coat. After many years, people decided to change Kermit from brown to green. One fun fact about Kermit is that he was originally meant to be a lizard, but he looked like a frog when Jim Henson initially finished making him. Therefore, Kermit remained a frog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another puppet that was featured in Sesame Street was Grover.  Grover is loyal, helpful, and always tries his hardest. Grover was originally green, but then people changed him to blue. When Grover was introduced to the show, he didn’t have a name. Grover was first introduced on The Ed Sullivan Show, and then he joined Sesame Street.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oscar is a green, rude Muppet, but he was purple in one of Jim Henson’s drawings. His voice was inspired by a taxi driver. He also used to be orange for a very short period of time. He lives in a trash can, so this is why he likes trash. Oscar’s attitude is based on a grouchy waiter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many Muppets, and some of them are very unique puppets. Oscar is rude, Grover is loyal and helpful, and Kermit the Frog is a funny Muppet. All of the Muppets make the shows very funny, popular, and unique. The Muppets are controlled by strings or by hands. The Muppet Show characters are all unique in their own ways.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Baymax103</name></author><summary type="html">Did you ever think that Muppets were made for educational purposes?

The most famous jelly bean maker in America is Jelly Belly, and it has been making candy since 1898. Some favorite flavors made by Jelly Belly are Buttered Popcorn, cherry, green apple, and much more.  The 3 main steps to make a jelly bean are forming a center, getting a shell, and then getting the jelly beans packaged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first step is to make the center of the jelly beans by cooking slurry which is made out of water, cornstarch, sugar, and corn syrup. Then the slurry flows into a machine called a Mogul that puts a precise amount of slurry into the molds, so that the jelly beans can take their shape. After that, the slurry in the mold is put into a room that has adjusted humidity for one night. When the slurry has been in that room for one night, it will form some unfinished jelly beans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On day two, the jellybeans get washed in sugar, so they will not stick to each other. Then jellybeans go to the Engrossing Department where they build up their shells, and this process takes two to three hours. In the Engrossing Department, there are spin cycles that rotate the rotate jelly beans. As they rotate, workers pour syrup and sugar into the spin cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the jellybeans are made, they need to be packaged. A machine packages jelly beans into small bags. Next, these small bags are put into a big box. When the box is full, it will be ready to be shipped to the stores. A famous jelly bean box around the world is called the Gift Box. The Gift Box consists of many different jelly beans and includes popular flavors. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people think that it only takes a few hours to make jelly beans, but it actually takes seven to ten days to make them. They first need to form their centers, then wrap their shells, and lastly get packaged and shipped out to other countries. Jelly Belly was founded by Gustav Goelitz, and has been making candy for over one hundred years. Jelly beans are not only delicious, but they are also fun because Jelly Belly created a game. In addition to making delicious candy, Jelly Belly also made a game you can play.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Baymax103</name></author><summary type="html">Jellybeans are a famous candy that people all over the world like to eat.

Speaker Pelosi, Leaders Schumer, McConnell, Vice President Pence, my distinguished guests and my fellow Americans, this is America’s day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is democracy’s day. A day of history and hope of renewal and resolve through a crucible for the ages. America has been test a new and America has risen to the challenge. Today, we celebrate the triumph not of a candidate, but of a cause, the cause of democracy. The people, the will of the people has been heard and will of the people has been heeded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve learned again that democracy is precious. Democracy is fragile. At this hour, my friends, democracy has prevailed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From now, on this hallowed ground, where just a few days ago, violence sought to shake the Capital’s very foundation, we come together as one nation, under God, indivisible, to carry out the peaceful transfer of power, as we have for more than two centuries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we look ahead in our uniquely American way: restless, bold, optimistic, and set our sights on natino we can be and we must be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thanks my predecessors of both parties for their presence here today. I thank them from the bottom of my heart. And I know the resilience of our Constitution and the strength, the strength of our nation. As does President Carter, who I spoke with last night, who cannot be with us today, but whom we salute for his lifetime of service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve just taken the sacred oath each of those patriots have taken. The oath, first sworn by George Washington. But the American story depends not on any one of us, not on some of us, but on all of us, on we the people who seek a more perfect union.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a great nation. We are good people. And over the centuries through storm and strife,in peace and in war, we’ve come so far. But wee still have far to go. We’ll press forward with speed and urgency, for we have much to do in this winter of peril and significant possibilities, much to repair, much to restore, much to heal, much to build, and much to gain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Few people in our nation’s history have been more challenged or found a time more challenging or difficult than the time we’re in now. A once-in-a-century virus that silently stalks the country. It’s taken as many lives in one year as America lost in all of World War II. Millions of jobs have been lost. Hundreds of thousands of businesses closed. A cry for racial justice, some 400 years in the making, moves us. The dream of justice for all will be deferred no longer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cry for survival comes from the planets itself, a cry that can’t be any more desperate or any more clear. And now a rise of political extremism, white supremacy, domestic terrorism that we must confront and we will defeat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To over come these challenges, to restore the soul and secure the future of America requires so much more than words. It requires the most elusive of all things in a democracy: Unity. Unity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In another January, on New Year’s Day in 1863, Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation. When he put pen to paper, the president said, and I quote: “If my name ever goes down into history, it’ll be for this act. And my whole soul is in it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My whole soul was in it today. On this January day, my whole soul is in this: Bringing America together, uniting our people, uniting our nation. And I ask every American to join me in this cause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uniting to fight the foes we face: anger, resentment,hatred, extremism, lawlessness, violence, disease, joblessness and hopelessness. With unity, we can do great things, important things. We can right wrongs. We can put people to work in good jobs. We can teach our children in safe school. We can overcome the deadly virus. We can reward, reward work, and rebuild the middle class and make health care secure for all. We can deliver racial justice and we can make America once again the leading force for good in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know speaking of unity can sound to some like a foolish fantasy these day. I know the forces that divide us are deep and they are real, bu I also know they are no new. Our history has been a constant struggle between the American ideal that we’re all created equal and the harsh, ugly reality that racism, nativism, fear, demonization have long torn us apart. The battle in perennial and victory is never assured.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through the civil war, the Great Depression, world war, 9/11, through struggle, sacrifice, and setbacks, our better angels have always prevailed. In each of these moments, enough of us have come together to carry all of us forwar. And we can do that now. History, faith and reason show the way, the way of unity. We can see each other not as adversaries, but as neighbors. We can treat each other with dignity and respect. We can join forces, stop the shouting and lower the temperature. For without unity, there is no peace —  only bitterness and fury. No progress — only exhausting outrage. No nation — only a state of chaos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is our historic moment of crisis and challenge. And unity is the path forward. And we must meet this moment s the United States of America. If we do that, I guarantee you will not fail. We have never, ever, ever, ever failed in America when we’ve acted together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so today at this time in this place, let’s start afresh, all of us. Let’s begin to listen to one another again. Hear one another, see on another show respect, to one another. Politics doesn’t have to raging fire, destroying everything in its path. Every disagreement doesn’t have to be a cause for total war. And we must reject the culture in which facts themselves are manipulated and even manufactured.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My fellow Americans, we have to be different than this. America has to be better than this. And I believe America is so much better than this. Just look around. Here we  stand in the shadow of the capitol dome, as was mentioned earlier, completed amid the Civil War, when the Union itself was literally hanging in the balance. Yet we endured, we prevailed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we stand looking out on the great mall where Dr. King spoke of his dream. Here we stand, where 108 years ago, at another inaugural, thousands of protesters tried to block brave women marching for the right to vote. And today we marked the swearing-in of the first woman in American history elected to national office: Vice President Kamala Harris. Don’t tell me things can’t change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we stand across the Potomac from Arlington Cemetery, where heroes who gave the last full measure of devotion rest in eternal peace. And here we stand just days after a riotous mob thought they could use violence to silence the will of the people, to stop the work of our democracy, to drive this sacred ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It did not happen. It will never happy. Not today, not tomorrow, not ever. Not ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To all those who supported our campaign, I’m humbled by the faith you’ve placed in us. To all those who did not support us, let me say this: Hear me out as we move forward. Take a measure of me and my heart. If you still disagree, so be it. That’s democracy. That’s America. The right to dissent, peaceably, the guardrails of our republic, is perhaps this nation’s greatest strength.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet hear me clearly: Disagreement must not lead to disunion. And I pledge this to you: I will be a president for all Americans. All Americans. And I promise you I will fight as hard for those who did not support me as those who did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many centuries ago, St. Augustine, a saint in my church, wrote that a people has a multitude defined by the common objects of their love. Defined by the common objects of their love. What are the common objects as we Americans love, that define us as Americans? I think we know. Opportunity, security, liberty, dignity, respect, honor and, yes, the truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent weeks and months have taught us a painful lesson. There is truth and there are lies, lies told for power and for profit. And each of us has a duty and responsibility, as citizens, as Americans,, and especially as leaders, leader who have pledged to honor our Constitution and protect our nation, to defend the truth and defeat the lies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look — I understand that many of my fellow Americans view the future with fear the trepidation. I understand they worry about their jobs. I understand, like my dad, they lay in bed at night, staring at the ceiling, wondering: Can I keep my health care? Can I pay my mortgage? Thinking about their families, about what comes next. I promise you, I get it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the answer is not to turn inward, to retreat into competing fraction, distrusting those who don’t look like you or worship the way you do, or don’t get their news from the same sources you do. We must end this uncivil war that pits red against blue, rural vs. urban, conservative vs. liberal. We can do this if we open our souls instead of hardening our hearts. If we show a little tolerance and humility, ad if we’re willing to stand in the other person’s shoes, as my mom would say, just for a moment, stand in their shoes. Because here’s the thing about life: There’s no accounting for what fate will deal you. Some days when you need a hand. There are other days when we’re called to lend a hand. That’s how it has to be. That’s what we do for one another. And if we are this way, our country will be stronger, more prosperous, more ready for the future. And we can still disagree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My fellow Americans, in the work ahead of us, we’re going to need each other. We need all our strength to preserve through this dark winter. We’re entering what may be the toughest and deadliest period of the virus. We must set aside politics and finally face this pandemic as one nation. One nation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I promise you this, as the Bible says: “Weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.” We will get through this together. Together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look, folks. All my colleagues I served with in the house and Senate up there, we all understand the world is watching, watching all of us today. So here’s my message to those beyond our borders: America has been tested and we’ve come out stronger for it. We will repair our alliances and engage with the world once again. Not to meet yesterday’s challenges, but today’s and tomorrow’s challenges. And we’ll lead, not merely by the example of our power, but by the powers of our example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll be a strong and trusted for peace, progress and security. Look — you all know we’ve been through so much in this nation. And my first act as president, I’d like to ask you to join me in a moment of silent prayer to remember all those who we lost this past year to the pandemic. Those 400,000 fellow Americans. Moms, dads, husbands, wives, sons, daughters, friends, neighbors and co-workers. We will honor them by becoming the people and the nation we know we can and should be. So I ask you, let’s say a silent prayer for those who’ve lost their lives, those left behind and for our country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Folks, this is a time of testing. We face an attack on our democracy and on truth, a raging virus, growing inequity, the sting of systemic racism, a climate in crisis, America’s role in the world. Any on of these will be enough to challenge us in profound ways. But the fact is, we face them all at once, presenting this nation with one of the gravest responsibilities we’ve had. Now we’re going to be tested. Are we going to step up? All of us? It’s time for boldness, for there is so much to do. And this is certain, I promise you: We will be judged, you and I, by how we resolve these cascading crises of our era.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will we rise to the occasion in the question. Will we master this rare and difficult hour? Will we meet our obligations and pass along a new better world to our children? I believe we must. I’m sure you do as well. I believe we will. And when we do, we’ll write the next great chapter in the history of the United States of America. The American story. A story that might sound something like a song that means a lot to me. It’s called “American Anthem.” There’s one verse that stands out, at least for me, and it goes like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The work and prayers of a century have brought us to this day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What shall be our legacy? What will our children say?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me know in my heart when my days are through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;America. America, I gave my best to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s add. Let us add our own work and prayers to the unfolding story of our great nation. If we do this, then when our days are through, our children and our children’s children will say of us: They gave their best, they did their duty, they healed a broken land.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My fellow Americans, I close the day where I began, with a sacred oath before God and all of you. I give you my word, I will always level with you. I will defend the Constitution. I’ll defend our democracy. I’ll defend America and I will give all, all of you. Keep everything I do in your service, thinking not of power, but of possibilities, not of personal interest, but the public good. And together we shall write an American story of hope, not fear. Of unity, not division. Of light, not darkness. A story of decency and dignity, love and healing, greatness and goodness. May this be the story that guides us. The story that inspires us and the story that tells ages yet to come that we answered the call of history. We met the moment. Democracy and hope, truth and justice did not die on our watch, but thrived. That America secure liberty at home and stood once again as a beacon to the world. That is what we owe our forebears, one another and generations to follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, with purpose and resolve, we turn to those tasks of our time. Sustained by faith, driven by conviction, devoted to one another and the country we love with all our hearts. May good bless America and may God protect our troops. Thanks you, America.”&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Baymax103</name></author><summary type="html">“Chief Justice Roberts, Vice President Harris.
