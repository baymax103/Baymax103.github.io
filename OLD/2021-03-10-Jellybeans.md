Jellybeans are a famous candy that people all over the world like to eat. The most famous jelly bean maker in America is Jelly Belly, and it has been making candy since 1898. Some favorite flavors made by Jelly Belly are Buttered Popcorn, cherry, green apple, and much more.Â  The 3 main steps to make a jelly bean are forming a center, getting a shell, and then getting the jelly beans packaged.

The first step is to make the center of the jelly beans by cooking slurry which is made out of water, cornstarch, sugar, and corn syrup. Then the slurry flows into a machine called a Mogul that puts a precise amount of slurry into the molds, so that the jelly beans can take their shape. After that, the slurry in the mold is put into a room that has adjusted humidity for one night. When the slurry has been in that room for one night, it will form some unfinished jelly beans.

On day two, the jellybeans get washed in sugar, so they will not stick to each other. Then jellybeans go to the Engrossing Department where they build up their shells, and this process takes two to three hours. In the Engrossing Department, there are spin cycles that rotate the rotate jelly beans. As they rotate, workers pour syrup and sugar into the spin cycle.

After the jellybeans are made, they need to be packaged. A machine packages jelly beans into small bags. Next, these small bags are put into a big box. When the box is full, it will be ready to be shipped to the stores. A famous jelly bean box around the world is called the Gift Box. The Gift Box consists of many different jelly beans and includes popular flavors.

Some people think that it only takes a few hours to make jelly beans, but it actually takes seven to ten days to make them. They first need to form their centers, then wrap their shells, and lastly get packaged and shipped out to other countries. Jelly Belly was founded by Gustav Goelitz, and has been making candy for over one hundred years. Jelly beans are not only delicious, but they are also fun because Jelly Belly created a game. In addition to making delicious candy, Jelly Belly also made a game you can play.
