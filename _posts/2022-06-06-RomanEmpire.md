### Location and Geography
Ancient Rome was a big powerful empire that spanned from Israel and Northern Africa all the way to the United Kingdom, spanning around 5 million square kilometers during its peak at AD 117. The vast empire surrounded the mediterranean sea. Ancient Roman civilization developed on the Italian peninsula near the tiber river, and was surrounded by the mediterranean, ionian, and adriatic seas. 50-90 million people populated Ancient rome at its peak. This was around 20% of the world population at the time. 
### Roman Government
Ancient Rome had a democratic form of government called the Roman Republic. It was founded in 509 BC by Rome's wealthiest citizens (Patricians) after the last Etruscan king was overthrown. The Assembly decided on important matters for the city. This new government consisted of three branches: The Assembly, The Senate, and The Consuls.

The Assembly was made up of Patricians and Plebeians. The Assembly elected government officials and the 2 Consuls. The Assembly could also vote on laws suggested by government officials and declare war on nations.

The Senate were advisors of the consul and other government officials, and they  could also approve or disapprove laws passed by the Assembly. The officials in the Senate held office for a lifetime.

Two Consuls were elected yearly, and both Consuls had to agree on a decision before the government could act on an issue. The two Consuls could also veto each other, and in a dire situation, one of the consuls could become a dictator in order to make fast decisions.

<b>Plebeian Revolt</b>
<br>
In 494 BC, citizens of Rome (Plebeians) began to fight against Patrician rule. Plebeians protested by refusing to do farmwork or serving in the army. Without workers to provide the Roman army with food, the Patricians decided to give Plebeians more rights in order to satisfy them. Over time, Plebeians began to have more rights, including the right to run for office.
