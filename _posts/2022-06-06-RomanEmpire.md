## Location and Geography
Ancient Rome was a big powerful empire that spanned from Israel and Northern Africa all the way to the United Kingdom, spanning around 5 million square kilometers during its peak at AD 117. The vast empire surrounded the mediterranean sea. Ancient Roman civilization developed on the Italian peninsula near the tiber river, and was surrounded by the mediterranean, ionian, and adriatic seas. 50-90 million people populated Ancient rome at its peak. This was around 20% of the world population at the time. 
## Roman Government
Ancient Rome had a democratic form of government called the Roman Republic. It was founded in 509 BC by Rome's wealthiest citizens (Patricians) after the last Etruscan king was overthrown. The Assembly decided on important matters for the city. This new government consisted of three branches: The Assembly, The Senate, and The Consuls.

The Assembly was made up of Patricians and Plebeians. Some of the duties carried out by the Assembly included electing government officials and the 2 Consuls, voting on laws suggested by government officials, declaring war, and vetoing the consuls' decisions.

The Senate were advisors of the consul and other government officials, and they  could also approve or disapprove laws passed by the Assembly. The officials in the Senate held office for a lifetime. The Senate could refuse to give money to the Consuls.

Two Consuls were elected yearly, and both Consuls had to agree on a decision before the government could act on an issue. The two Consuls could also veto each other, and in a dire situation, one of the consuls could become a dictator in order to make fast decisions. The Consuls also acted as judges for any cases.

#### Plebeian Revolt

In 494 BC, citizens of Rome (Plebeians) began to fight against Patrician rule. Plebeians protested by refusing to do farmwork or serving in the army. Without workers to provide the Roman army with food, the Patricians decided to give Plebeians more rights in order to satisfy them. Over time, Plebeians began to have more rights, including the right to run for office.

#### First Triumvirate
The First Triumvirate included Caesar, Pompey, and Crassus. This alliance ruled Rome from 60 BCE to 54 BCE. In 53 BCE, Crassus was killed in a battle. By 48 BCE, Caesar had defeated Pompey in the decisive Battle of Pharsalus. Following his defeat, Pompey sought refuge in Egypt, where he was assassinated by the courtiers of Ptolemy XIII.
#### Second Triumvirate
The Second Triumvirate included Augustus (Octavian), Mark Antony, and Marcus Lepidus. The triumvirate was created in 43 BCE, and was known for organizing the republic. This alliance ruled as a military dictatorship, and it outranked the consuls and magistrates. However, this alliance was unstable and would not withstand the jealousy of the 3 leaders. The triumvirate broke apart when Lepidus and Octavian had a dispute over the issuing of land. In 36 BCE, Lepidus was forced into exile in Circeii, and lost all of his offices except for that of Pontifex Maximus. Octavian accused Lepidus for trying to start a rebellion, and trying to take power with force. As this was happening, Mark Antony, had married Cleopatra, trying to use Egypt for its wealth, to influence Rome. Another war broke out with Octavian on one side, and Mark Antony and Cleopatra on the other. In 31 BCE, Cleopatra and Mark Antony’s forces were defeated at Actium. Octavian's forces pursued Cleopatra and Mark Antony all the way to the coastal city of Alexandria, where they both committed suicide in 30 BCE.

## Roman Architecutre
Roman architecture was influenced by Greek style. They built aqueduts,amphitheaters, thermaes,temples, houses, and apartment blocks. Romans experimented with arches and domes. Most Roman buildings were made of marble and concrete. Roman concrete was developed around 2 BCE. The Romans also developed a unique mortar recipe which included volcanic sand or (pozzolana). As concrete evolved, Roman arches, water fountains, pillars and other creative shapes started to appear.

Many people ask why did Gladiators fight to death? The answer is that the colloseum was built solely for entertainment. Gladiators fought each other, and animals. Slaves were often forced to fight each other. Sometimes during fights, Gladiators would ask the crowd to show mercy or to not.

#### Pantheon
